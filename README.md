ok this thing is a remade of Keith Galli videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8-snVfekto&amp;t=2099s

First if you want to make the background you must add the photo to the same folder as the WeatherApps.py saved, so in this line

background_image = tk.PhotoImage(file='landscape.png')
You must download the photos that i give in the code too or this is the links : http://www.mediafire.com/file/tp1fg46zrzcvz3q/landscape.png/file

You download it and move it to a folder that your WeatherApp.py saved, or if you want more details, watch my videos
